# Final Project - Common Issues & Delays in Air Travel

</div>



## <b>Reason why we selected this topic</b>


For the past century, air travel became the most popular and convenient means of travel for long distances. Nevertheless, it is not uncommon to encounter various problems along the way, including aircraft technical issues and mishandled luggage. Additionally, the most common issue travelers face are delays and cancellations that can be caused by inclement weather or overbooking. 

Despite all of these issues, air travel still remains as the most popular choice for many people, therefore, understanding these issues and the data behind it can be hugely beneficial for future travel.  




## <b>Description of Source of Data</b>

We will explore multiple datasets of flight information and use statistical and machine learning techniques to predict whether an issue may arise while traveling.

The primary source of the data will be exported from raw CSV files by the [Bureau of Transportation](https://transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?gnoyr_VQ=FGK) and the [Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.asias.faa.gov/apex/f?p=100:1::::::).



## <b>Main Topics We Hope to Address with the Data</b>

With the datasets provided, we hope to create comprehensive analysis and visualizations for:

* Overall analysis and comparison of the most common issues among airlines in the US
* Probability of flight interruptions and problems
* Correlation of flight accidents with time of day, cities, etc... 
* Flight issues related to inclement weather 
* Mishandled baggage



## <b>Description of Communication Protocols</b>

As the primary source of communication, a Slack group was created. Additionally, we will utilize the alloted time in class meetings to discuss our projects/assignments collaboratively.
